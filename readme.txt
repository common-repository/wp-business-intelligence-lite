Dynamic web charts and tables for your site! Connect to your live WordPress instance DB to retrieve data in real-time and update charts and tables!

== Description ==
WP Business Intelligence Lite allows you to powerfully display responsive data tables and charts on your website. This plugin is simple to use and allows you to connect with your wordpress database and display the data in real time. Once you have created at least one SQL query that retrieves data from your DB, you can define the type of chart (bar, donut, line, or grouped bar) or table to be used to display them. A simple shortcode embeds the chart or table in any post or page. Each page refresh retrieves the data from the DB so that the information in the chart or table is always up-to-date.
